# Fault_Detection
- Classification of different faults in the dairy industry based on recorded data
## Data Source
- We have gathered data via a dairy plant producing milk powder.
- The data gathered was cleaned and explored using heat maps.
## Data Utilization
- The data was used to create linear as well as non-linear models to predict the exit 
  air temperature.
- Faulty data was then introduced and labelled in order to simulate real-time environment.
- Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, Decision
  Tree Classification and Voting Classification were used in order to classify faults according 
  to their labels.
